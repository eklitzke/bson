BSON serialization and deserialization logic.
Specifications taken from: http://bsonspec.org/#/specification
The following types are unsupported, because for data exchange purposes, they're
over-engineered:
	0x06 (Undefined)
	0x07 (ObjectId)
	0x09 (UTC datetime - Sorry, but Python's datetime module sucks.
		datetime.now() has no timezone? Seriously?! Simple timestamps will save
		you a lot of trouble)
	0x0b (Regex - Exactly which flavor do you want? Better let higher level
		programmers make that decision.)
	0x0c (DBPointer)
	0x0d (JavaScript code)
	0x0e (Symbol)
	0x0f (JS w/ scope)
	0x11 (MongoDB-specific timestamp)

For binaries, only the default 0x0 type is supported.
